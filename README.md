# JavaScript-Projects
This repository contains all the JavaScript files I have been assigned to create during my JavaScript Course at The Tech Academy.

**Project 1 Expression Alerts** This file contains my first lesson in JavaScript, which is creating an alert message.

**Project 2 Functions** In this project, I learned how to call on functions to make a webpage more interactive. You can click on the text on the document to learn something new about me!

**Project 3 Math Operators** This project was about the various ways you can perform math using JavaScript. Click on each math operator to see a math problem relating to the operator.

**Project 4 Dictionaries** I created a dictionary by assinging multiple values to a variable. I then called on a value I wanted to display on the document, but in this case the value was deleted, therefore there is an undefined value that will display.

**Project 5 Comparisons Type Coersion** In this project I played around with different types of data, such as numbers and string values. The data was compared into true or false statements. I also used coersion to combine the different data types.

**Project 6 Ternary Operations** This project was about conditional statements, constructor functions, and nested functions. 

**Project 7 Scope Time Function** In this project I learned the difference between local and global scope by assigning variables in different positions to see the different outcomes. I also used the time function to display a message depending on the time of day.

**Project 8 String Method** This project shows the different string methods available in JavaScript. I learned to concatenate and slice strings, as well as calling the function to display a precise length of string.

**Project 9 Countdown Slideshow** I created a countdown that is interactive, as well as a slideshow with images and captions.

**Project 10 Loops Array** In this project I created a loop to count to ten. I also created an array and selected a value from the array to display.

**Pizza Project** I created a pizza menu where a user can choose their pizza size and toppings. Once they place their order, an order total will add up to display the cost of their order.

**Calculator** This is a fully functioning calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

**Tic Tac Toe Game** A user can play tic tac toe against a computer. There are sound effects added to make it more fun!
